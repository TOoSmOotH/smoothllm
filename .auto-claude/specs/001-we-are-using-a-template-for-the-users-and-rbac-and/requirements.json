  "task_description": "We are using a template for the users and RBAC and themes called smoothweb. I want to add my customizations to it. It will be called \"Smooth LLM Proxy\" docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md has details on how to  use this template. Using this template allows us to skip having to create user management etc. I want to  create an application that is similar to litellm. Do research on the functionality. Users should be able\n  to add API keys to their favorite LLM providors or loacl models and we should keep detailed stats on it.\n  We should just proxy it and user the user agent of the requesting client. That way when they hit say the\n  claude api it comes from roo code and not our proxy. The use would specify the costs of the LLM asn we\n  will track that. The user would then create API keys on smooth llm proxy which would then use the\n  condifugred key for the end llm. The user would set up their client to use smoothllm and the model name\n  that we are proxying like litellm does it.",
